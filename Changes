Revision history for Perl module HTTP::WebTest.

1.99_04 Sun Feb 17 2002

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Improve syntax error reporting in parser of wtscript files.

* Support for embeded Perl in wtscript files.

* Added test parameters 'user_agent' and 'show_headers'. Thanks to
Markus Kucborski for patch.

* Updated docs on format of wtscript files. Thanks to Richard
Anderson.

* HTTP-WebTest does follow redirects after POST now. Note that it
breaks RFC but actually it is semi-standart behaviour of all
browsers. Thanks to Thieme Geoff for bugging me about it :)

* Added non-core plugin HTTP::WebTest::Plugin::Hooks which defines two
new test parameters: 'on_request' and 'on_response'.

INCOMPATIBILITIES:

* Test parameters validation API have been changed. All plugins have
been fixed to conform new API. This change is required for proper
support of embeded Perl in wtscript files.

* Changed format of wtscript files. Speaking more precisely rules for
test parameters value quoting have been changed to be more Perl
alike. It means that value of param should be written either as

    value - any string without special chars like => or ). It is
    treated in same way as in old HTTP::WebTest

    "value" - usual Perl string quoting rules apply (i.e sequences
    like \n, \r, etc are treated as special and " can be escaped with
    \"). It is new in HTTP::WebTest.

    'value' - usual Perl string quoting rules apply (i.e sequences
    like \n is not tread as special but ' can be escaped with
    \'). This change breaks previosly allowed ''value'' style for
    escaping quote characters.

Also Perl expression in curly brackets can be
specified instead of test parameter value. Like

    url = { "http://" . 'somehost.com' }

 1.99_03 Mon Jan 28 2002

   * Numerous documentation fixes. Thanks to Richard Anderson for
     reviewing and correcting POD docs.

   * Renamed 'show_cookie' test parameter to 'show_cookies' as it was
     in HTTP-WebTest 1.xx.

   * Added 'default_report' test parameter which can be used to
     disable test report output from default report plugin. It can
     be useful if it is desired to use another report plugin for test
     output.

   * Added report plugin HTTP::WebTest::Plugin::TestHarness which
     provides report output compatible with Test::Harness.

   * Renamed method HTTP::WebTest::validate_test to
     HTTP::WebTest::validate_params. Make it validate hash with test
     parameters instead of test object.

   * Now HTTP::WebTest does validate global test parameters.

   * Names of tests specified in wtscript files was ignored. It is
     fixed now.

   * Added some content to HTTP::WebTest::Cookbook.

   * wt program will read test specification from standart input if no
     wtscript filenames were specified as its arguments.

 1.99_02 Fri Jan 18 2002

   * Moved autogenerated documentation on general module usage into
     HTTP::WebTest. Moved code and API documentation from
     HTTP::WebTest into HTTP::WebTest::API. Suggested by Richard
     Anderson <richard@richard-anderson.org>.

   * Regenerate all autogenerated documentation before creation of
     distribution. Don't create it during module build and
     installation stage (i.e. perl Makefile.PL; make; make
     install). Suggested by Richard Anderson
     <richard@richard-anderson.org>.

   * Numerous documentation fixes.

 1.99_01  Sun Jan 13 2002

   * Added support for third party plugins. Added documentation on
     writting plugins.

   * Wtscript parser does check syntax of wtscript files.

   * Bug fixes

 1.99_00  Mon Jan  6 2002

   * Major rewrite of module. The aim of this rewrite is plugin based
     architecture which allows to extend module functionality with
     plugins.

 1.07  Tue Nov 20 2001

   * HTTP::WebTest now uses Config.pm to find correct shebang string
     for script 'wt'. It should correctly set path to perl interpreter
     even if perl is installed in non-standart place.

   * Added test parameter mail_from which allows to set From: header
     in report e-mails. Thanks Joe Germuska <Joe.Germuska@JGSullivan.com>
     for the patch.

 1.06  Sat Aug 11 2001

   * Some files required for local web files testing mode were missing
     in last HTTP-WebTest distributions.

 1.05  Wed Aug  8 2001

   * Installation of http-webtest directory is optional now for Unix
     platforms. It is completely disabled on Win32 platform.

   * Mentioned in docs that this module should work on Win32
     platform. Bug reports from this platform would be appreciated.

   * Do not use environment variable WEBTEST_LIB in 'wt' script. It
     seems to be needed only for debuging purposes and it was a source
     of many Perl warnings if it was not defined.

   * Sample Apache config file bundled with this module now contains
     directives to disable usage of apache access and resource config
     files.

   * HTTP::WebTest now uses File::Temp module for secure creation of
     temporary directories.

   * Removed section 'CHANGES' from HTTP::WebTest POD docs since it
     became too long. Anybody interested in changes should consult
     this file.

 1.04  Mon Jul 16 2001

   * Added PREREQ_PM entry into Makefile.PL. Thanks Britton
     <fsblk@aurora.uaf.edu> for suggesting this.

   * Fixed bug: test parameters accept_cookies and send_cookies did not
     affected transmission and receipt of cookies at all.

 1.03  Wed Jul  4 2001

   * First release by new maintainer.

   * Fixed bug with passing form params with POST requests.

 1.02  Tue Jun 26 2001

   * OWNERSHIP OF HTTP:WebTest HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM Richard
     Anderson <Richard.Anderson@raycosoft.com> TO Ilya Martynov
     <ilya@martynov.org>.  PLEASE DIRECT ALL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS 
     TO Ilya Martynov.  So long, and thanks for all the fish.

   * Change succeed/fail count so that a successful fetch of a 
     page counts as a successful test.  (An unsuccessful fetch
     still counts as a failed test.)

   * Removed extraneous call to extract_cookies from get_response.

 1.01  Wed Jun 14 2001

   * Modified cookies parameter to allow less than 10 elements.  
     (Thanks to Thomas Ayles <tayles@arsdigita.com> for suggesting
     this.)

   * Fixed bug that caused get_response() to fail to capture all 
     cookies returned by the webserver during redirects.  Added
     subclass HTTP::WebTest::Cookies (a modified HTTP::Cookies
     class).  (Thanks to Ilya Martynov <ilya@martynov.org> for
     this fix.)

   * Modified web server response time measurement to be more 
     accurate.

   * Exported run_web_test method so it can be called directly.

 1.00  Wed Jun 06 2001

   * Added max_rtime and min_rtime parameters to test web server 
     response time.  The perl module Time::HiRes is now a
     prerequisite to install HTTP::WebTest.  (This code was
     a collaborative effort by the author and Michael Blakeley 
     <mike@blakeley.com>.)

   * Added pauth parameter for proxy authorization.  (This code 
     was a collaborative effort by the author and Darren Fulton 
     <Darren.Fulton@team.telstra.com>.)

   * Changed max_bytes and min_bytes paramters from test block 
     parameters to global and/or test block parameters.

   * Made format of output report more robust for max_bytes and 
     min_bytes parameters.

 0.30  Mon Mar 05 2001

   * Fixed ./t/*.t files so that "make test" runs correctly on 
     Solaris.  (Replaced export WEBTEST_LIB= with WEBTEST_LIB= ; 
     export WEBTEST_LIB.)  (Thanks to M. Simon Cavalletto 
     <simonm@evolution.com> for reporting this bug.)

   * Improved clarity of documentation and program output.

 0.20  Mon Feb 26 2001

   * Fixed bug that caused module to abort when a HTTP-Redirect 
     (302) is sent back with a relative URL.  Thanks to Andre 
     Machowiak <ama@ision.net> for this fix.

   * Set Content-type to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' 
     for POST.  Thanks to Andre Machowiak <ama@ision.net> for
     this fix.

   * Modified Makefile.PL to get path of perl using the which 
     command and create the wt script with this path in the 
     she-bang line (#!).  (Thanks to Britton <fsblk@aurora.uaf.edu>
     for reporting this bug.)

   * Modified "make test" tests to write output to files in the 
     t subdirectory.

 0.01  Sat Dec  9 2000

   * Original version; created by h2xs 1.19.

   * First release to CPAN by Richard Anderson
     <Richard.Anderson@raycosoft.com>.
