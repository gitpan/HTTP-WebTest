* generate index of test parameters in a reference

* reread all docs to check if it makes any sense

* add pointers on ::HarnessReport in HTTP::WebTest docs

* embeded Perl in wtscripts

* add support for interactive queries for auth and pauth params

* save_output option for backward compatibility API

* extended syntax of wtscript files which allows nested structures

* support for file upload tests

* automated tests for mail sending

* plugin for page validation with HTML::Validator
