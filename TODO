* add support for interactive queries for auth and pauth params

* test, test, test and test it with code and .wt files which were
  written for stable HTTP-WebTest

* save_output option for backward compatibility API

* automated tests for mail sending

* plugin for page validation with HTML::Validator

* report plugin with output compatible with Test::Harness (using
  Test::Builder ?)

* embeded Perl in wtscripts

* simple navigation using link names and button names (with HTML::Form)

* HTTP proxy which autogenerates skeleton of test file

* support for file upload tests
