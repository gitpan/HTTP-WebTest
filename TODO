My current TODO:

* write cookbook

* separate global and normal test parameters in a reference

* generate index of test parameters in a reference

* reread all docs to check if it makes any sense

* add support for interactive queries for auth and pauth params

* save_output option for backward compatibility API

* automated tests for mail sending

* plugin for page validation with HTML::Validator

* report plugin with output compatible with Test::Harness (using
  Test::Builder ?)

* embeded Perl in wtscripts

* simple navigation using link names and button names (with HTML::Form)

* HTTP proxy which autogenerates skeleton of test file
