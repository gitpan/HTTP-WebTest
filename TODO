My current TODO:

* Consider using XPath expressions (in Click plugin and on their own)

* rewrite HarnessReport plugin using Test::Builder

* support hidden fields in Click plugin

* polish local mode tests - they are *very* non portable now (or just
move Apache plugin in separate distro for the starters)

* automated tests for mail sending (even better unit tests for all
code)

* plugin for page validation with HTML::Validator (HTML::Lint ? or both ?)

* Generator of Perl and wtscript code from test objects

* HTTP proxy which autogenerates skeleton of test file (consider using
HTTP::RecorderSession framework)

* HTML formated reports

* Report plugin which stores all responses as local files.

* Support including of test scripts into other test scripts

* More work on cookbook. Probably I need one example of very simple
plugin.

* Add test name into errors text
