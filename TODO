My current TODO:

* test broken tests diagnostics

* resurrect all parameter checks from old HTTP::WebTest

* generate index of test parameters in a reference

* polish local mode tests - they are *very* non portable now

* add support for interactive queries for auth and pauth params

* save_output option for backward compatibility API

* extended syntax of wtscript files which allows nested structures

* support for file upload tests

* automated tests for mail sending

* plugin for page validation with HTML::Validator

* Generator of both Perl and wtscript code from test objects

* HTTP proxy which autogenerates skeleton of test file

* HTML formated reports

* Report plugin which stores all responses as local files.
