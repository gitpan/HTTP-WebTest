My current TODO:

* Add start/end test sequence hooks into Hook plugin

* rewrite HarnessReport plugin using Test::Builder

* do not fail in make test if Algorithm::Diff is missing

* support hidden fields in Click plugin

* polish local mode tests - they are *very* non portable now

* automated tests for mail sending

* plugin for page validation with HTML::Validator (HTML::Lint ? or both ?)

* Generator of Perl and wtscript code from test objects

* HTTP proxy which autogenerates skeleton of test file (consider using
HTTP::RecorderSession framework)

* HTML formated reports

* Report plugin which stores all responses as local files.

* Support including of test scripts into other test scripts

* More work on cookbook. Example with $Test::dbh should be
clarified. Probably I need one example of very simple plugin.
