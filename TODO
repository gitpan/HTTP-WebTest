My current TODO:

* port .wt parsing code (somewhat finished - syntax checks are missing)

* polish local mode tests - they are *very* non portable now

* add support for interactive queries for auth and pauth params

* write tutorial

* add test parameters which allows to load third party plugins

* write plugin writer guide

* test, test, test and test it with code and .wt files which were
  written for stable HTTP-WebTest

* save_output option for backward compatibility API

* automated tests for mail sending

* plugin for page validation with HTML::Validate

* report plugin with output compatible with Test::Harness (using
  Test::Builder ?)

* embeded Perl in wtscripts

* simple navigation using link names and button names (with HTML::Form)

* HTTP proxy which autogenerates skeleton of test file
