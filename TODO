My current TODO:

* support hidden fields in Click plugin

* polish local mode tests - they are *very* non portable now

* extended syntax of wtscript files which allows nested structures

* support for file upload tests

* automated tests for mail sending

* plugin for page validation with HTML::Validator

* Generator of both Perl and wtscript code from test objects

* HTTP proxy which autogenerates skeleton of test file

* HTML formated reports

* Report plugin which stores all responses as local files.
