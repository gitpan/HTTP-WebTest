Please note that cookie tests require your hostname to contain at
least two dots. Otherwise these tests will be skipped.

If test script doesn't detect your hostname correctly you can set it
with environment variable TEST_HOSTNAME.

Response time and 'apache_max_wait' tests can take long time. It is
possible to disable them by setting environment variable TEST_FAST.

Once report plugin changes its output format it will break most tests
since they compare output with reference files in t/test.out
directory. Test scripts can update reference files in t/test.out if
environment variable TEST_FIX is set. But before setting this variable
always double check that report format have been changed but not tests
have been broken.

Another useful environment variable is TEST_VERBOSE. If it set then on
'make test' it will be possible to see output from test scripts which
helps debugging a lot. All tests that use reference files in
t/test.out will print difference between reference files and actual
test reports if any.
