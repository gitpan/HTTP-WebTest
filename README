NAME
    HTTP::WebTest - Testing static and dynamic web content

DESCRIPTION
  Introduction
    This module runs tests on remote URLs containing
    Perl/JSP/HTML/JavaScript/etc. and generates a detailed test report. This
    module can be used "as-is" or its functionality can be extended using
    plugins. Plugins can define test types and provide additional report
    capabilities. This module comes with a set of default plugins but can be
    easily extended with third party plugins.

    The wt script is provided for running "HTTP::WebTest" from the command
    line.

    The test specifications can be read from a parameter file in wtscript
    format or input as method arguments. The test results can be displayed on
    the terminal, directed to a file, stored in a scalar variable. The test
    results can also be emailed. The report can be modified and extended using
    report plugins.

    Each URL/web file is tested by fetching it from the web server using a
    local instance of an HTTP user agent. The basic test is simply whether or
    not the fetch was successful. You may also test using literal strings or
    regular expressions that are either required to exist or forbidden to
    exist in the fetched page. You may also specify tests for the minimum and
    maximum number of bytes in the returned page. You may also specify tests
    for the minimum and maximum web server response time.

RESTRICTIONS / BUGS
    This module have been tested only on Unix (e.g., Solaris, Linux, AIX,
    etc.) but it should work on Win32 systems.

    If you want to test https:// web sites you may have to install additional
    modules to enable SSL support in LWP. In short you may have to install
    Crypt::SSLeay module. For details see README.SSL file in LWP distro.
